# ARSLIGHT 
It's an e-learning platform, for dyslexic children .
Most of the features integrated in this project are based on Deep learning models. 
This project is divided into 2 sections : 

front-Arslight (front-end) : we created the front-end using Angular . 

back-Arslight (back-end) : we created the back-end using django .

you can find them both on my profile. 

Good Luck.
